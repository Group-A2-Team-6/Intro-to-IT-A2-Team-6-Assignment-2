<h1>Software Test Analyst</h1>
<h2>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>
<p>Being a software test analyst entails testing systems or programmes produced by software developers. The main role of the test analyst is to ensure that the developed programme meets the requirements specified by other professionals such as a business analyst. Further, they are to make sure that the programme works completely free of faults.</p>
<h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h2>
<p>Working closely with other IT professionals is the most essential aspect of being a software test analyst. Not only do they work closely with project managers, they are often the first called upon by the wider development team when confronted by an issue. They are also responsible for keeping developers date with the status of the project, meaning they must have a strong relationship with the whole development team.</p>
<h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
<p>Software testers typically work in offices in a team orientated setting involving meetings and lots of work behind a screen. They are most likely to work standard business days with holiday and weekend work not uncommon.</p>
<h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>
<p>As collaboration is essential in this profession, sufficient communication stands out as the most challenging aspect of being a professional test analyst. The development team relies heavily on feedback and direction from the tester, meaning poor communication skills will only result in more problems to resolve. The challenge is presented in keeping large teams on the same page and up to date, sometimes across different time zones.</p>

<p>Project managers work closely with; development teams, test analysts and other departments within organisations such as Finance teams, etc. Managers also have a role interacting with clients for feedback, or just as the main consultant for the project.</p>
<h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
<p>While many would believe that the role would consist of days exclusively behind screens, in truth managers will spend a majority of the time in meetings in various locations, or as a face to face advisor around the workplace.</p>
<h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>
<p>Just as people are a manager's greatest resource, so to can they cause the greatest challenges. Being a project manager requires strong leadership skills, which to the majority of people, do not come naturally. Not being able to resolve issues within a team or give clear directions are detrimental to the advancement of projects.</p>
</div>
<div id="networkengineer">
<h1>Network Engineer</h1>
<h2>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>
<p>The roll of a mobile app developer consists of developing mobile apps that are built based on what is specified by clients, or for the general public. Mobile development entails everything from design to testing and maintenance of programs suited for mobile devices.</p>
<h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h2>
<p>A professional in this role will interact with team members on a daily basis. Further than just the development teams they work in however, mobile developers will also interactive with clients and potentially even investors. Interaction with clients is integral in the profession as a large majority of apps need to be built to strict, defined specifications. Additionally, professionals who develop for the general public will see plenty of interaction with both potential and current investors.</p>
<h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
<p>App developers would mostly find themselves sitting behind a desk, with limited face to face meetings. Many have indicated that due to the stagnant nature of the profession, getting outside of offices and exercising have become a sizeable part of their days.</p>
<h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2>
<p>The main challenges in app development seem to come from the work itself rather than any issues with environment. Due to the ever-increasing volumes of different mobile devices and software, compatibility issues have fast become the most challenging aspect of mobile app development. Developers must demonstrate keen attention to detail in order to build seamless programmes using differing procedures for the growing number of devices.</p>
