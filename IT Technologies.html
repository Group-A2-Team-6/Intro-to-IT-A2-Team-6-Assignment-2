<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence based around the idea of systems learning and improving themselves without being explicitly told what and how to do so. These systems sort through data to find patterns and make predictions.</p>
<p>There are many different machine learning algorithms that could be considered the current state of the art. A subset of machine learning called deep learning for example uses algorithms called artificial neural networks to learn from unstructured data and come to its own conclusions (Brownlee, 2019). BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is another, using bidirectional training for Natural Language Processing. This innovation helps predict and understand natural language flow (Horev, 2018)</p>
<p>Although the field has not existed for long, machine learning becomes more profitable and wide-reaching every year and is already being used for a variety of applications. With machine learning has come the possibility for self-driving cars. Semi-autonomous cars are already in use, with fully autonomous cars predicted to join them by the end of the decade (SAE International, 2018).</p>
<p>Another application of machine learning, and probably the one that has caused the biggest impact on everyday life so far, is targeted advertising. Targeted advertising uses machine learning algorithms to predict what a person would want to buy, or what media they would want to consume. As advertising companies gather increasing amounts of data, the predictive ability of these algorithms will continue to improve in accuracy. These types of predictive algorithms have a great success rate, one example being Netflix, with 75% of users watching recommended titles that come from machine learning algorithms (Columbus, 2020).</p>
<p>Machine learning is also being used internationally for military purposes. Many countries are developing semi-autonomous and fully autonomous weapons (Cronk, 2019). These weapons use algorithms to identify and neutralise targets, with the aims of increasing accuracy and minimising loss of life. Companies like PayPal have also started looking into ways that they can use machine learning for economic purposes, such as credit scoring and fraud prevention (Shah, 2019). In the next few years, AI and machine learning are predicted to be used to help prevent ‘compromised’ hardware components from entering supply chains (Booz, Allen, Hamilton, 2019).One in five workers in high-level jobs are predicted to have their work assisted by an AI by 2022, with low-level tasks almost completely being taken over by machine learning.</p>
<p>The impact of machine learning will be huge and on a global scale. Its impacts will not only be felt in business and technology, but by everyday people. It is already being seen in consumer technologies like Google Home, Amazon Alexa and in mobile devices.</p>
<p>Worldwide spending on machine learning and AI in 2019 reached $37.5 billion and is predicted to reach $97.9 billion by 2023 (IDC, 2019). Data is becoming increasingly valuable and in demand, and companies are fast to bring machine learning along to make the most of it. Big data fuels machine learning and has been referred to as the next industrial revolution and remarks such as "The world's most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data." (The Economist, 2017). Machine learning has revolutionised data science and has led to data being some of the most sought after and most valuable property to companies.</p>
<p>Education and training are also going to be impacted by the rise of machine learning, shifting what skills and jobs are in demand. Repetitive and data centric tasks are already being automated, and some redundancies have been caused from these jobs being replaced by machine learning. White-collar workers in fields like accounting and data entry have been the main ones that have already been affected by the shift. Processing and analysing data is also easily taken over by machine learning and completes the job more efficiently than a person does. Most industries will feel the effects of machine learning in some say, either positive or negative, as new jobs and fields will be created while others disappear. People focused jobs that need care and empathy are unlikely to be replaced any time soon.</p>
<p>As I am trying to start a career in the IT industry, the main aspect of daily life that machine learning will affect will be my job. It will require putting some extra thought into how the industry is going to change in the coming years, so as not to end up in an area where jobs are disappearing. What jobs do and don’t exist, and what will be in demand is predicted to shift rapidly, so I will need to keep that in mind when planning and gaining qualifications.</p>
<p>In terms of it affecting members of my family or my friends, everyday life should improve as we will see machine learning and AI continue to make its way into consumer tech. Devices such as home assistants and biometrics like FaceID already exist to make our lives easier, and we will continue to see different and improved technologies that use machine learning over the years. Enhanced healthcare will improve health and wellbeing and possibly even increase life expectancy.</p>

<div id="autonomousvehicles">
<h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Autonomous vehicles have come to prominence in mainstream and automotive media in recent years, a big driver of which has been Tesla with their autonomous vehicle position, some aspects of which has been demonstrated in the Models S, X, 3 and Y and the self-driving modules available in each vehicle. The popularity seems reflected by the consumer public as deliveries of Tesla vehicles equipped with self-driving modules have soared from 75,000 units in 2016, to 367,000 units in 2019, with Tesla set to maintain the growth with a record Q1 delivery in 2020 of 88,400 units (Wagner I 2020).</p>
<p>In the Transport and Logistics sector, autonomous vehicles have manifested through companies such as Unmanned Life with their AI-driven Autonomy-as-a-Service platform delivering light parcel sorting, inventory management and the potential for low-scale last-mile delivery for organisations supply chains (Unmanned Life 2020). Unmanned Life utilises drones operated and controlled through a central platform to carry out set objectives (Unmanned Life 2020). At this stage human intervention is still required in the process flow to enable seamless operation, however the potential capital expenditure reduction when comparing drone systems to robotic solutions is vast (Unmanned Life 2020).</p>
<p>With the rapid introduction of 5G the possibilities for autonomous vehicles begin to rapidly expand. Although there is yet to be an adequate uniform solution to the inability of 5G mm-wave to penetrate indoors (Penttinen, JTJ 2019), the introduction of 5G opens up large amounts of bandwidth which is unavailable on the current, already stressed LTE network (Penttinen, JTJ 2019). With increased speeds and capacity the potential for autonomous vehicles to operate on more open, hive-like networks may increase the technological availability of widespread autonomous vehicle fleets, such as the driverless taxis potentially offered by organisations such as Uber, Lyft and Tesla.</p>
<p>Within the next 3 years it is likely that development of autonomous service platforms will continue at a fast pace, with 5G networks allowing an incredible rate of mobile data flow and thereby enabling more complex processes and systems to operate efficiently. At this moment, systems such as the light parcel sorting service and the inventory management system have limited hardware development (Unmanned Life 2020), however with greater mechanical capability combined with a greater processing and network capability suggest at a quantum leap in autonomous potential for supply chain organisations.</p>
<p>Firms such as Unmanned Life (2020) are touting last-mile delivery systems currently, so the next logical leap is a move to complete end-to-end downstream supply chain capabilities in a limited capacity. For example, picking, sorting and delivery of simple, single line item orders from factory outlets or distribution centres with nearby end-users. For widespread rollout in Australia there must be significant type certification and some sort of unit certification for the drones and drone systems. At current, CASA has strict mandates regarding the operation of drones, such as the operational window of 30-120m altitude, restrictions on flying in populous areas and maintaining line-of-sight between the operator and drone at all time (Civil Aviation Safety Authority 2020). There are no provisions for autonomous drone flights (Civil Aviation Safety Authority 2020). Therefore organisations such as Unmanned Life would have to invest significant effort to develop Safe Work Procedures, Drone Type Certification, and likely collaborate with CASA to develop certification standards for organisations seeking to operate commercial autonomous drone systems.</p>
<p>Considering the freedom and flexibility enjoyed through the use of personal passenger vehicles, it seems unlikely that self-driving passenger vehicles will directly replace typical automobiles due to the capital investment required and the increasing congestion. Self-driving vehicle networks may address congestion problems but this would require significant adoption by the consumers and a high-level of collaboration between organisations (Maciejewski, M & Bischoff, J 2018), which is unlikely. Moreover an increase in vehicle trips is also possible if autonomous taxi’s can be introduced in such a manner as to make travel more convenient and affordable, thereby increasing congestion (Maciejewski, M & Bischoff, J 2018). More likely is the potential for autonomous mass-transit vehicles, which may achieve economies of scale with a much less complicated network and would be viewed as desirable from an economic and environmental standpoint.</p>
<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
<p>The ability to implement autonomous vehicles in an industry setting will likely only occur with the most innovative firms, beginning with larger firms with high volume supply chains, such as K-Mart who have previously embraced and perfected potentially complex supply chain techniques such as Offshoring (Molloy, S 2018), and the most progressive of small-to-medium enterprises.</p>
<p>There will be little to no impact to line-haul or consolidated freight with the exception on packaging to facilitate handling by autonomous drones at a later stage. In all distribution and collation centres there is the potential for redundancies in warehouse picking and packing operations. However in larger operations it is possible that there will be no change in staffing when compared to robotic production lines as the quality control process will still require similar labour input, the autonomous systems simply preferable from the reduction in capital expenditure and the potential to increase output capacity.</p>
<p>Robotics is logically a complimentary technology to autonomous systems. With fixed mechanical production lines a lot of money and space is required, and the process is pre-determined and largely fixed. Pairing advanced robotics with an autonomous management system has the potential to optimise cost, output or throughput, and space. although the lower capital expenditure requirements may make the systems more readily available to firms.</p>
<p>Autonomous systems paired with robotics to make functional drones likely allow more freedom in configuration. Therefore the may be an increased focus on optimisation with the potential for greater yields. As such there may be an increased demand for experienced supply chain managers and analysts who can identify, plan and implement measures to exploit potential opportunities.</p>
<p>The result of all this is an increase in service for customers as the supply chain activities shorten. As such the increase of pace for distributers will require strong process flows and competent management to thoroughly achieve all efficiencies.</p>
<h2>How this will affect me</h2>
<p>As a Supply Chain Manager in a marine construction company the early implementation of autonomous vehicles opens opportunities within my organisation and with allied transporters. A Supply Chain is now our company function, it is not a given that innovation realises a benefit and analyses must be carefully conducted to ensure ROI. An additional complication is that infrastructure construction projects do not typically have a long duration, ranging from a couple of months up to 2 or 3 years. Therefore for maximum benefit the systems, uses, and processes should be developed on a corporate level and implemented early in the project life.</p>
<p>A huge benefit is the potential for reductions in supply time from request to receival. The result of this is the ability to carry lower inventory, react quicker to urgent requests, to breakdowns for example, and the potential decrease in service cost. On the other hand there may potentially be larger variations in service quality between organisation. Therefore there will be a requirement for all firms to develop strong supplier evaluation and pre-evaluation mechanisms.</p>
<p>The potential for greater economy of scale opportunities is high and sourcing objectives and strategies will shift accordingly. As such strategic procurement opportunities may change as a result of the objective shift. With new working methods, it is likely new supplier interactions and methods of sale may take place, requiring a readjustment from supply chain professionals. For example, with full or semi automation controlled by an AI system, functional and system analysts may be appointed from the previously operational staff. There is no necessity that all operations are carried out from the base itself, a desirable situation for the firm and the workers both.</p>
<p>Autonomous mass transit capabilities may engender increased infrastructure investment and development from governments. With developments resulting form covid-19, attitude changes in the populace may result in changes to travel and transit habit. The focus and priority might switch from the freedoms offered by personal vehicles to economies offered by mass transit options.</p>

<h1>Robots</h1>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>By definition, a robot is “Any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner.” (Moravec n.d,). They come in many different forms, and while some roboticists argue that even a thermostat or dishwasher could be classed as a robot the basic attributes of a robot are its ability to sense, compute and act. (Guizzo, n.d).</p>
<ul>According to Gailliard (n.d) The most common applications of robots today include:
<li>Industrial: such as those used for car manufacturing, space exploration and other jobs classed as too dangerous or requiring a high degree of precision.</li>
<li>Social: Robots utilised in a social setting such as a dancing robot for entertainment or mimicking a patient for medical students to practice on.</li>
<li>Toys: One of the most obvious option for Robot applications would be Toys that can be played with such as robot dogs and Robosapiens which have the ability to sing, walk, dance, talk and provide sentry security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some robots are used in restaurants to make sushi, chop vegetables and serve drinks; some are used for crime fighting like bomb disposal robots and robots sent into hostage situations; some are used in an educational role in classrooms helping students sound out words; and some are used around the home for vacuuming, mowing lawns and cleaning pools (Staples, 2018).</p>
<p>Some are also being used to build houses due to their precision and speed, like those designed and built by West Australian based company Fastbrick Robotics. (Fastbrick Robotics, 2018)</p>
<p>Some robots are also being used to assist in keeping doctors and nurses out of harms’ way helping to treat those sick with Coronavirus, or simply as an extra set of hands/ legs in delivering meals (Presse, 2020).</p>
<p>According to Guizzo (n.d) currently some constraints on robots include cost and complexity, although given time and an increase in popularity parts for robots will become cheaper.</p>
<p>In the next 3 years it is likely that there will be an increase in the use of Robots in the form of drones with the ability to deliver parcels, groceries, fast food and even medicine, such as those operated by Wing Aviation (Wing Aviation, n.d)</p>
<p>According to Gonzalez (2017), Joint Robotics laboratory and Airbus group are currently developing a robot able to climb ladders and crawl inside tight spaces on aircraft to perform maintenance. The purpose being that confined spaces can be dangerous and the Robots are able to distribute their weight more evenly in spaces where electrical looms, and hydraulic/ pneumatic pipes route through. NASA is also developing robots for possible future space missions that are able to build living compounds on Mars.</p>
<p>The invent of Wifi and Bluetooth have increased the ability for users to be able to control assorted devices from a distance. As time has gone by battery technology has also advanced providing more powerful batteries in a smaller size and 3D printing as well has also enabled people to manufacture components at home without the use of large machinery.</p>
<p>According to Ho (2018), some of the advancements in technology that have helped robots become what they are today include Light direction and ranging (LIDAR) systems, 2D vision, 3D vision, Microphones, Capacitive sensors and Proximity sensors. Sensors that measure pressure, temperature and torque are becoming cheaper which is also believed to spur the growth in Robot technology. Microprocessors are becoming more powerful and the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are equally attributed to the growth in Robot technology.</p>
<p>The rise of the internet of things (IOT), a term given to all the devices connected to the internet collecting and sharing data, will also likely spur future growth in robot technologies where different technologies in the home have the ability to communicate with each other (Ranger, 2020)</p>
<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
<p>With the growth in IOT and the increase in connected devices in our everyday life, there will likely be impacts to our privacy and security. As we welcome devices into our homes and workplaces, so too we will be putting out the welcome mat for corporations to weave their way into our routines and so targeted advertising will become more inescapable</p>
<p>With the plethora of cameras and microphones attached to the devices that we will likely invite into our home there will also be an increase in the need for bolstered security measures which will spur the growth in voice and face recognition and retinal and fingerprint scanners.</p>
<p>With robots replacing humans in menial tasks, humans themselves will also be forced into roles that require increased levels of training and a requirement to have a greater understanding of technology, which will benefit society by increasing the knowledge base of humankind.</p>
<p>As scientists work to develop robots for hospital patients and nursing homes (Gilliard, n.d), AI technology that can predict heart disease (Ho, 2018), and robots that can help to exercise stroke victims (Gonzalez, 2017), it is likely that robots will help free up doctors to be able to concentrate on higher value tasks like developments in the field of medicine, also helping to increase human life expectancy.</p>
<p>Given the advances in medicine and Robots replacing humans in areas of industry that traditionally have exposed workers to hazardous situations/ chemicals/ substances, the average lifespan for humans could also likely benefit.</p>
<p>While it is believed that Robots will replace humans in many dangerous or repetitive tasks, humans will also be required for the development, maintenance, manufacture and sale of robots, robot components and robot related technologies. As machines have been invented over time to make work easier for humans, humanity itself hasn’t seemed to have suffered greatly from laborious tasks being made easier but have instead allowed humans to progress and spend their time solving more in-depth problems.</p>
<h2>How this will affect me</h2>
<p>In the short term (1-3 years) it is likely I won’t experience any great increases of the presence of robots in my home except for entertainment (kids toys, big boys toys etc.), for instance I don’t expect to be owning a lawn mowing/ house cleaning robot any time soon and home deliveries of food and groceries by drones to me still seems a bit gimmicky and I can’t see myself relying on them frequently. Currently, on a personal/ everyday level, my interaction with robots is limited to one that sweeps/ vacuums my floor.</p>
<p>Once I step out onto the street, however, this may be a different story, it is likely that packages we are currently receiving through the post from online orders will be delivered solely by drones where possible in 3 years.</p>
<p>Considering the current price constraint on robotics, it is safe to assume that in the near future we won’t see robots replacing humans scanning my items at the grocery store check-out, or stacking the shelves. Until robot technology is commonplace and is considerably cheaper, for robots to start replacing human jobs in earnest, the jobs would need to be that critical to help save human life in order to justify the expense, like sending a robot into a burning building to survey for/ or even to provide temporary protection for humans</p>
<p>Other applications could involve robots replacing humans in airport immigration with the ability to identify and analyse facial expressions of incoming/ outgoing passengers trying to conceal their reasons for travel in a bid to combat the trafficking of drugs or terrorism.</p>
<p>Robots could also replace humans in other areas where human factors such as stress, fatigue or bias could also affect important decision making, like air traffic control towers.</p>
</div>
<div id="blockchainandcryptocurrencies">
<h1>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h1>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies which uses complex cryptography to record value and transactions in a database called a blockchain (Cointelegraph 2017). A blockchain is a large network of users to record transactional data on a closed forum after verification by miners as a committee (Cointelegraph 2017). It is an extremely secure method of transaction tracking, as each transaction record is input as a complex code containing the transaction record, the public key of both the origin and destination, a node of complex prime numbers, and the record of the preceding transaction which is verified by all crypto-miners and then transmitted to all users in the network before being accepted into the blockchain (Cointelegraph 2017). The blockchain is stored with all users on the network and thus is very difficult to fabricate, as the fabrication must be duplicated on each user in the network to be accepted into the blockchain. After so many transactions the data is sealed off into a block, and a new block is started (Cointelegraph 2017).</p>
<p>Courtesy of its decentralised organisation it is, in principle, a more stable peer-to-peer electronic currency as it has no governing authority subject to regulation changes and mismanagement. Instead it is subject to regulation by proxy as central banks and governments implement economic policy surrounding cryptocurrencies. All confirmed transactions are irreversible and touted as unforgeable. Miners receive transaction fees and a reward of a cryptocurrency per number of confirmed transactions completing a block, currently at 6.25 bitcoin (Wilson, T 2019).</p>
<p>Although cryptocurrency and its most popular manifest, bitcoin, linger in the minds of most as a distasteful combination of investment scam and voodoo magic, there is a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a form of legal tender by vendors and institutions. At this moment, bitcoin can be used to pay for such services as hotel accommodation, flights, computer parts and college degrees (Cointelegraph 2017).</p>
<p>For bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to become more “mainstream” there must be more widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a form of legal tender. This would likely require endorsement from large of major banking institutions, through integration with their banking platform, or development of relationships with other larger organisations to enable the ability to trade goods and services for bitcoin.</p>
<p>In the next three years there is the potential for development of cryptocurrencies in commerce or e-commerce. With the introduction of such applications as Google Pay and Apple Pay, it doesn’t seem infeasible that development of hardware to enable a mobile cryptocurrency payment method is conducted. Whether this manifests as a separate piece of hardware for each different currency of whether a collaborative effort can be conducted to produce an all-in-one remains to be seen. Cryptocurrencies desperately need a user friendly platform both on functional payment and viewing, as noted by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel (Cointelegraph 2017).</p>
<p>Another option is the independent development of a large-scale online uniform cryptocurrency web platform that acts as a virtual marketplace. This would require significant investment from an organisation to develop the supply-chain relationships with traditional vendors, and develop the payment infrastructure to ensure the decentralized objective of cryptocurrency, transaction confirmation rewards and fees are maintained for miners, and that the platform does not inflate the cost of goods.</p>
<p>Another barrier to widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies is the volatility of the values due to investment. While the investment hype surrounding cryptocurrencies remains, organisations and individuals may be reluctant to embrace the system due to the inherent risk involved. A basic investment principle is that investors expect to be rewarded for engaging in risk investment activities. At this stage the rewards are not well communicated and otherwise the potential stakeholders may perceive the rewards to be unproportionate to the investment risk.</p>
<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have the potential to be integrated into, or replace secure online payment platforms such as paypal, or venmo. It is the logical step forward in the context of the aim of these existing platforms, and logically the benefit to these platforms when considering the cost of insurance against scam transactions such as duplicate transactions is high (Cointelegraph 2017).</p>
<p>With greater demand generated by new sales platforms using cryptocurrencies, the price for the more popular cryptocurrency will increase as has been seen consistently since 2013 (Cointelegraph 2017). This will lead to a “split” of the currency, similar to the bitcoin halving conducted in March 2020 (Wilson, T 2019), whereby volume increases and price decreases inversely proportionately to accommodate new holders in a similar way to shares. This increase in volume will assist in the decrease of the price volatility through diversification of users. In addition to the increase in volume, as platforms open up to enable easy methods of payment and purchase using cryptocurrencies, the use of cryptocurrency will shift from a mixture of currency and investment commodity to largely and primarily a currency.</p>
<p>An interesting angle is whether cryptocurrencies will be picked up by certain industry regulators as the mandated method of tender due to transparency and inability to fabricate transactions and balances. In the banking industry it may have key usage moving forward.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is unlikely to replace any common job positions, however if it continues its momentum it may be more broadly accepted, resulting in firms who lag in development shrinking slightly through competitive deficit. These positions will logically be absorbed by the firms who grow by exploiting their competitive advantage.</p>
<h2>How this will affect me</h2>
<p>As a Supply Chain Manager it is important to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to new technological innovations. E-Commerce is playing an important role in the 21st century supply chain and cryptocurrency can play an important part in that. Cash management may be difficult as I work for a multi-national company and balancing the requirement for different denominations and the objective to maximise profit will require significant effort. Although this may be offset by the potential supply-chain benefits of secure supply and best value. It would be interesting if clients offer payment split between local denomination, U.S. dollars, and cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>My fiancé is an aged-care nurse at a not-for-profit facility. With progressive management and such new e-commerce platforms it may be that her facility can exploit cryptocurrency as an opportunity. In this instance, cryptocurrency may become available from the residents, either through their own funds or as a transfer of an investment asset from the residents own superannuation funds.</p>
<p>Two of my brothers are working full-time in IT and one other brother is working part-time in IT to supplement his income. As a result they possess reasonably high-end consumer-grade PC’s capable of 3D modelling and animation. They may be able to take their hardware and turn the computing power towards cryptocurrency mining for the transaction fees and the rewards (Cointelegraph 2017). The first user to complete the transaction is awarded the transaction fees and associated benefits. As such, they would not turn their attention towards high-end cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, but would instead seek to mining lower value cryptocurrency, largely ignored by bigger organisations, for 0.50c to $10 per day such as Litecoins, Dogecoins and Feathercoins were in 2017 (Cointelegraph 2017).</p>
