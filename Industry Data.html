<h2>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>Financial Planner/ Investment Analyst, As a financial planner/ investment analyst isn’t exactly classed as an IT job, there isn’t any demand in the IT field from employers.</p>
<h2>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>As a Financial Planner/ Investment Analyst it is presumed some knowledge of Microsoft Windows would be beneficial, the 4th most sought after IT skill.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office experience (the 18th most sought after IT skill), would be beneficial because Micosoft word would be used to compile reports, Excel for the use of spreadsheets and Powerpoint for producing and giving presentations.</p>
<p>For a Senior position in a Financial Planning firm some business management skills wold be beneficial, the 7th most sought after IT skill.</p>
<p>Building relationships (8th most sought after IT skill) would be beneficial in both the financial planning/ investment analysis field where you are required to build a rapport with clients and the team you work with day-to-day.</p>
<h2>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>Skill set of a financial planner- Communications and Interpersonal skills, Ability to handle stress, Energy and persistence, Analytical skills for problem solving, passion, Organisational skills and attention to detail.</p>
<p>Skill set of an Investment Analyst- Analytical skills, Communication Skills, Computer Skills, Decision Making Skills, Detail Oriented, Math Skills.</p>

<h2>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>

<h2>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
<p>As my required skill set contains the three highest generic skills (Communication, Problem Solving, Organisational skills) the next three highest ranked skills not in my required skill set are: Writing, Team work/collaboration and troubleshooting</p>
<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
<p>In a way, yes, I was surprised how closely some of the IT skills in demand aligned with those required of a Financial Planner or Investment Analyst. I was also mildly surprised to see how many of the generic skills of my desired jobs also showed up in the demand list.</p>

<h2>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>The ideal job, Fleet Manager – Containers and General, is not a position in the IT industry but is instead in the Logistics and Freight Industry. There is a significant shortage in Australia of highly-skilled supply chain professionals (DHL 2020) and as such there is a high demand for highly-skilled people to fulfil Distribution and Fleet Manager positions (Sabell, M 2019).</p>
<h2>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>As a Fleet Manager I would not require specialist IT skills to excel in daily operations, although one team or department member would need to be highly skilled in such areas for data preparation and presentation purposes. However,  analyses can be more efficiently carried out with reasonable level of underpinning knowledge.</p>
<p>As such a Fleet Manager should at minimum have reasonable skills with Microsoft Windows, A project management software package, an Enterprise Resources Planning and Enterprise Asset Management software packages, of which SAP is the industry leader, and the Microsoft Office Suite, particularly the online variants (Job Outlook 2020)(Sabell M 2019)( Toll Group 2020).</p>
<ul>When assessed against the Burning Glass IT Specialist skill sets these rank as follows:
<li>Microsoft Windows – 4th most desired.</li>
<li>Project Management (software such as Primavera) – 5th most desired.</li>
<li>SAP (Significant ERP/EAM experience) – 6th most desired.</li>
<li>Microsoft Office – 18th most desired.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>A Fleet Manager is typically a regional or national position and in an organization the likes of Toll it is a high-level position requiring a high level of general and management skills. As a strategic management position the candidate must have not only a high level of supply chain expertise as well as a high level of management skills. However the successful candidate may not be the one whom has the highest level of specific expertise.</p>
<p>The Fleet Manager will be responsible for a large group of people on multiple sites, and may be even solely or jointly responsible for a Depot Manager or Depot Managers. Therefore, the Fleet Manager must be a successful communicator, able to solve problems quickly and effectively, have sound organization and planning skills, have a high level of written comprehension be capable of working collaboratively as at a strategic level it is unlikely that planning can be solidified without input from key stakeholders, and good time management skills to meet organizational goals and customer requirements (Job Outlook 2020)(Sabell M 2019)( Toll Group 2020).</p>
<ul>When assessed against the Burning Glass General skill sets these rank as follows:
<li>Communication – Most desired.</li>
<li>Problem-solving – 2nd most desired.</li>
<li>Organisational skills – 3rd most desired.</li>
<li>Writing – 4th most desired.</li>
<li>Team work/collaboration – 5th most desired.</li>
<li>Planning skills – 7th most desired.</li>
<li>Time Management skills – 12th most desired.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
<ul>The highest ranked IT-specific skills that are not in the required skill set are:
<li>SQL – most desired.</li>
<li>Javascript – 2nd most desired.</li>
<li>JAVA – 3rd most desired.</li>
<p>It is highly unlikely that heavy use of these skills would be required for a Fleet Manager, although such skills may be infrequently of advantage.</p>
</ul>
<h2>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
<ul>The highest ranked general skills that are not in the required skill set are:
<li>Troubleshooting – 6th most desired.</li>
<li>Detail-oriented – 8th most desired</li>
<li>Creativity – 9th most desired</li>
<p>These skills would be of benefit to a Fleet Manager, but they will not be judged on the level of competency in each skill. That is to say, a candidate with a slightly higher skill in trouble-shooting would not be valued much higher than one with a slightly lower skill level.</p>

<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
<p>My opinion of my ideal job has not changed, the Burning Glass data more or less affirmed what I considered as necessary. It was interesting to see that skill with the Microsoft Office Suite is ranked so low as an IT-specific skill, although that may be because in the IT industry it is almost a given.</p>

<p>Software Developer</p>
<h2>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>The title of ‘software developer’ can be rather vague in terms of a job description. However, by analysing data from Burning Glass Technologies’ ‘Top Titles’ findings in 2018, it is safe to say that the title ranks within the top quarter of jobs in demand from employers in the IT field. This is including the various roles in the research such as; web developer, java developer, .net developer, etc.</p>
<p>Further, the Australian Governments’ ‘Job Outlook’ website has ranked software and applications programmers in the top four of their ‘Higher Skilled Jobs on the Rise’ list. This indicates that while demand for software developers is already high, it is also likely to grow in the coming years</p>
<h2>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
<p>The IT-Specific skills that are required for the position in software development include; exceptional proficiency in Python and JavaScript programming languages. It is also a requirement of the candidate to be able to accommodate the real-time communication of data through libraries such as Socket.IO.</p>
<h2>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
<p>According to the data supplied by Burning Glass Technologies, JavaScript proficiency ranks as the second most in-demand skill in the IT field. Python proficiency, on the other hand, ranks as the 22nd most demanded skill from the same data set. When looking at programming languages in the data set, Python is ranked fifth (the least popular on the graph). A more recent article from Business Insider Australia ranks Python as the second most popular (on GitHub) programming language, behind only JavaScript. This indicates that the demand for skills in Python could potentially be on the rise in the coming years due to its strong and growing popularity. Socket.IO is not listed on this data set, however a similar skill (Git) is ranked as the 21st most in demand skill.</p>
<h2>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
<p>The three most in-demand skills (excluding JavaScript) in the IT field are; SQL, Microsoft Windows and Project Management. Although these are not listed as required for my ideal job, it is likely that these three skills would be very desirable, or even essential, throughout other roles in software development.</p>
<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
<p>Having interpreted the data, my opinion on a software development role has changed significantly. Previously, I assumed the position held a higher value on independent work. It has since been made evident that both communication and collaborative skills are far more prevalent in this role than I thought suspected. This has given me a more favourable outlook on this field than before as I find collaborative working far more rewarding.</p>
