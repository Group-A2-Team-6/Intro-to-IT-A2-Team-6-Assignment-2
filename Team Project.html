<h1>Team Project</h1>
<p>A project that the Base Information Technology team are greatly interested in is a smartphone app that will assist recreational fishermen in a variety of ways. The application will take an accessible and easily manageable form and allow users to; mark fishing spots by location and store relevant data, connect with friends and fishing professionals, and suggest new locations for users based on collected data and the users’ chosen fishing method.</p>
<p>Fishing remains relatively untouched by the growing world of mobile technology. As there are an estimated five-million people in Australia alone who participate in recreational fishing (Statistics, 2003), we view this application as a great opportunity to bring a traditionally primitive hobby into the modern world of technology, all the while accessing a new market in app development.</p>
<p>One feature of the app will allow users to mark specific locations via GPS and gather information that will again be made accessible to the consumer in a well presented and user friendly manner. This information will be gathered automatically by the program from various websites and data agencies. The data that will be collected by the program will include; the location of fish where they are caught, the tide (and its size), water temperature, currents, time of day and weather conditions, and countless more relevant variables. Data that cannot be collected automatically will require user inputs and will incorporate; the type (and size) of fish, the tackle use, how accessible the location is, water depth, as well as the depth where the fish hit the line. Other data supported by the app will be things such as dates and pictures.</p>
<p>Rather than just storing the data, this program will then feed it back to the user based on specified filters or smart suggestions. This could work two ways. Firstly, by allowing the user to search for a specific fish. This will return various locations within a certain radius (specified by the user) where these fish have been caught in volumes. Preferred bait, optimal tides (when they feed in the cycle, incoming or out coming, etc.) and most successful tackle will all be returned to the user to give them the best chance of catching their target. Secondly, a user could instead choose to enter a location, rather than a target fish. This would then return what fish are likely to be caught at that particular spot, all while taking into account the weather, time of day, and season.</p>
<p>Another feature that we have considered is adding a social aspect to the application. This would allow users to follow friends or public figures allowing them to share locations, catches and discuss with each-other. This would also allow existing fishing charters to charge subscription fees for information such as fishing spots and tips through our application.</p>
<p>Initially the app will be built for IOS and Android devices. This means there are a number of necessary tools and technologies required to build and accommodate the program. The software required to build the IOS app includes the Apple Xcode toolkit. For the Android app, programs such as Android Studio or Eclipse are needed. The data collected by the app will be centralised as we aim make the most of cloud computing, limiting requirements on the consumer end. The hardware requirements are, as a minimum, a device capable of comfortably running software development kits.</p>
<p>The skills required by the team to build and maintain the application are great competence in both Swift and Java programming languages. Further, strong skills win various aspects of cloud computing are also necessary. More specifically, database skills and developmental operations proficiency.</p>
<p>Ideally, this project will become an essential tool for all people who love to fish recreationally, such will be the value of the information gathered. Not only will it advance the understanding of experienced anglers, but it will give confidence to those who are wishing to start.</p>
